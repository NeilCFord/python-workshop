### Idle and more Python
**This whole section needs replacing as it is superseded by the initial program walkthrough and the reaction timer exercise.**
- Introduce other Idle tips: history, configure for larger font size etc.
- work quickly through python tutorial: http://bit.ly/py-tutor until get to the guess the number game. Build this up slowly so:
 - break for a discussion about how it’s going to work.
 - as a group write #comments in a file
 - convert the #comments to python codes
 - introduce random library to make it a game
 - introduce loops to wrap the game in a number of guesses
 - introduce break to quit when the player wins the game.
