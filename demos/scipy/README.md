# Scipy

scipy is a set of maths/engineering and science functions. It also depends on numpy.

# Demos

3 demos (taken from the cookbook), show scipy in use for plotting a 3d surface, solving an intersection of a pair of equations, and showing a simple bar chart

# Documentation

Great documentation and a cookbook are available from:

* http://docs.scipy.org/doc/
* http://wiki.scipy.org/Cookbook

# Requirements

## Windows

Install a precompiled binary from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#scipy
For graphing matplotlib is required as well, which will also then need pyparsing and dateutil - all available from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/

## Mac/Linux

sudo pip install scipy
sudo pip install matplotlib
