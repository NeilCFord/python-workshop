# EasyGui

EasyGui is easy to use, but limited in its abilities. It's not possible do do things like games or drawing programs. But to ask the user a few questions and respond, it's very straight forward.

Another limitation is that development on EasyGui is now finished, which means the library won't get any better, and support will be limited.
