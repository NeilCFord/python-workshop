# EasyGui

EasyGui is easy to use, but limited in its abilities. It's not possible do do things like games or drawing programs. But to ask the user a few questions and respond, it's very straight forward.

Get EasyGui from https://pythonhosted.org/easygui/index.html or install using pip install easygui
