# Pygame

Pygame is a library that makes it much easier to write games in Python. It
covers things like:

* Sounds
* Graphics
* Things happening in parallel
* Events

It takes a bit of work to get up to speed on how to use it, but there are a lot
of good resources out there.

Take a look at our [snake example](snake/README.md) for a beginner project.

# Object Orientated Programming

A lot of Pygame is based around Object Orientated Programming (OOP). It's easier
to write your games in an object orientated way.

For some pointers on OOP, check out these resources:
