# opencv

From http://opencv.org/about.html

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library.

The library has more than 2500 optimized algorithms, which includes a comprehensive set of both classic and state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning algorithms. These algorithms can be used to detect and recognize faces, identify objects, etc.

# numpy

The cv2 module is the latest python module for opencv. It depends on another python module called NumPy which is a highly stable and fast array processing library.

Everything in cv2 is returned as NumPy objects like ndarray and native Python objects like lists,tuples,dictionary, etc. So due to this NumPy support, you can do any numpy operation here. 

NumPy is documented here: http://www.numpy.org/
