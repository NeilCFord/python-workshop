# A web server

Running a web server is a way to share files and control to other computers. In this example, we start the web server running on port 8080, so you'd need to point your browser to

    http://localhost:8080/

A simple index.html file is served, and if you click the 'hello' link we print 'hello' - proving the concept that we could do something useful here.

Start the server like this:

    python serve.py
