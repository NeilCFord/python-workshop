# PIL - Python Imaging Library

PIL can be used to process images; great for resizing, making thumbnails, processing large numbers of images etc. 

We can also create new pictures with text and standard geometric shapes.

# Creating new images

The demo creates a new image and then draws a series of different coloured rectangles on top.
