# PIL - Python Imaging Library

PIL can be used to process images; great for resizing, making thumbnails, processing large numbers of images etc. 

We can also create new pictures with text and standard geometric shapes.

# Demos

## Creating new images 

The rectangles demo creates a new image and then draws a series of random rectangles on it. See the link below for more shapes.

## Processing an image

The process demo loads the previously created image, rotates it and then scales it before saving it. See the link below for more options.
